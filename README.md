Source Code for my [porfolio website](http://thattacoguy.net).

**ttg.net** follows the normal TacoWolf design scheme, and implements a few elements such as [typed.js](mattboldt/typed.js) and [animate.css](daneden/animate.css). It also has my face, so that's fun. It runs primarily off of [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/), as do most of my web projects.
