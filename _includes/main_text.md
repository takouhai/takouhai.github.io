Hey! I'm Daniel.

I'm a Digital Storyteller working at West Virginia University's LGBTQ+ Center. 

I love making things that are fun and easy to use, look good and work great. I have experience with Graphic Design, Creative Writing, Full Stack Development, Node/JS, Ruby/Ruby on Rails, HTML5/CSS3/JS,  Video Editing, and much more!

I run [TacoWolf](https://tacowolf.net) along with a few friends of mine. It's my little home away from home.

I'm currently studying at West Virginia University to get a degree in Multidisciplinary Studies, consisting of:

* English
* Spanish
* Computer Science
* LGBTQ+ Studies
* Latin American Studies
