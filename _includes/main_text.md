Hey! I'm Daniel.

I'm a Software Developer, Web Developer, and Graphic Designer.

I love making things that are fun and easy to use, look good and work great. I have experience with JavaScript/Node, Ruby/Rails, front-end web development, video editing, vector graphics, bitmap graphics, and graphic design.

I run [TacoWolf](https://tacowolf.net) along with a few friends of mine.

I'm currently studying at West Virginia University to get a Bachelor's in Computer Science.

Let's make something together!
